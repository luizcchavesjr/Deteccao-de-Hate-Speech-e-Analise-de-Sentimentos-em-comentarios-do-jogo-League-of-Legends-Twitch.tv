then teamfight and roam for the rest of the game
hasn't had his 1st kiss yet
he goes clubbing a few times, i see on his insta story
@foggedftw2 so does the challenge continue???
there's a reason virgin is banned in his chat
@fogged can u even catch up to TF if he doesn't go on a tilt streak?
@kroncriz china's players too, even na players got chall if i recall, anyway, they were duo abusing the whole time to build up synergy, it doesn't really count

@foggedftw2 so what was the bet between you and blade now???
@foggedftw2 do you still ban neeko?

@sporwal she is his girlfriend bruv

If Fogged ends the Month with higher LP, then TFBlade will gift him 500 subs. If TFBlade (who is allowed to play off champs if Trynd is banned) wins then Fogged won't owe him anything. The Trynd only challenge has been rescheduled to May in EUW

we are in the future 0.o
whatever is good for you fogged
i hate watching streams with map cover, because i like to pay attention on everything while they play to think for myself as well

If Fogged ends the Month with higher LP, then TFBlade will gift him 500 subs. If TFBlade (who is allowed to play off champs if Trynd is banned) wins then Fogged won't owe him anything. The Trynd only challenge has been rescheduled to May in EUW

The rumor come out: does juice world is died? From weed?? Juice world is dead is the most discussed in the media in the few years ago. but some of the public still curious about what is exactly happening and to be the reason there is a rumor comes out about his die. At that time he became the massive social networking rumor. The public, especially his fans are shocked. Its is come that he died on overload from weed. This is scary because of especially so many kids do it now.

@lamescimitar321 the laning phase is not hard against mord cause he can clear the wave fast (if you get intimated by him, you can ask for a gank), for the late game many champs have good late game as mord.

tf blade cheating so much in that challenge, whats the point of having a tryndamere challenge when you dont even try to hide your queue to stop people from banning your champ

Essence Reaver has 20% CDR, 70AD, and 25% crit. The passive is irrelevant.

@pipkin_d_bun no
it's more for the CDR
@Pipkin_d_bun nope

and shyv complains again LUL
Ohh gotcha ty ty

Then you have to invade jungle etc. but that relies on your laners with prio to come help
Why did he change his name?
Is the junglers job to get their lanes ahead or is the junglers job to win the game?
Also trynd support
@foggedftw2 tryn with lulu or zilean is also nasty mid game

wait till you play against something better than lucian
that's because the lucian was so fcking bad
they are bad LUL
ah k thanks
@foggedftw2 nami is a lot of sustain as well tho
the bard was decent
@foggedftw2 have you seen tfblades game against bard top?
@TomasTheJoker cuz they're human
but that lucian has no idea how to play the waves or bully
Lucian bard never truly engaged tryn with poke much at all though.
Neeko would be pretty good for trynda then i suppose?
4TOP ?

Nami is an excellent support for melee adc’s, for healing, attack increase, and movement speed.
the problem is u wont always get the nami @foggedftw2 u might get like an autofill nautilus that suicides
youd struggle a lot more vs like cait

What if you don't have friends :(
all supports should duo, so they dont have to deal with useless adcs
did he name change his challenge account?

@yuyi1979 BibleThump
All supports should duo too, autofilled adc is awful
!king
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=kingoftryndamere
kinda gross dmg wtf
@yuyi1979 Add a random support that played well in soloq
lucian is super ass atm
auto fill support is the easiest to deal with, id rather have an autofill support than auto fill mid or jungle
Truth @rrogerrr
lol every autofill picks EZ and has no idea how to play him
is the bet still on even if TFblad played jax/irelia?
dmg
autofill top is the best
When does this challenge end?
Yes @bentongfu
lmao taking fleetfoot RUNES the benefits - Less Stressed in lane phase - You can look for trades like mad man cause of the effect of runes and your Q and you always u win trades - Rushing Stormrazor it helps alot -Still good for late game -In simple words best rune

Honestly TF Blade playing Vlad is not cheating, he is arguably worse at Vlad than at Trynd
@sfax_iano Cause tfblade decided he couldn't do it so he can play other champs. if Tfblade wins, he gets no prize. If fogged wins he still gets the 500subs

@DaPreacherBoi when you're fed and it takes 2 ore more to kill you, you can draw pressure away from objective and ur team gets obj for free
I would tell him to increase his screen movement speed a bit, seems really low
@DaPreacherBoi because it makes the enemy team come to him so its a 4v4 at baron, or they6 ignore tryndamere and lose the game

@DaPreacherBoi applying pressure to get ppl on u i think
on the settings you know
@DaPreacherBoi because if the enemy team 4 man responds to you in bot lane while your team is around baron they lose baron. If they don't respond to you, you take inhib and possibly end the game

@foggedftw2 what would you think of a marine drill sergeant tryndamere skin. since Tryndamere is always yelling and doing push ups it makes sense.
thats why you pay for individual lessions.
@swatkats happy birthday FeelsBirthdayMan
pls can someone answer when will he update the guide i need it
@SwatKats lemme get dat other one, I need more :D
u are the best fogged
when he coached me, we went over cs, and basics.

@foggedftw2 Hi fogged, is it a good idea to otp Renekton top in Silver?
@foggedftw2 do you think rengar is the best jungler to learn if u want to 1v9 in the jungle?
@ibnussef they're really similar actually the first game he was playing an unranked player and the second he was playing a silver

@SwatKats it is the best means to improve long term, ya get the obvious things fixed via the first session and then the harder stuff next.
@foggedftw2 it’s crazy how you and TFBlade have such different play styles on the same champion. Just looking at the extra number of deaths and kills seems to say how much riskier TFBlade plays.

I’ve been having trouble with the akali and Darius matchup with Tryndamere. Any suggestions?
@sweetberrygirl you realize that both channels got a HUGE influx of viewers from the challenge and generated WAY more than 2500, they both gained money regardless of outcome.
@Zongo16 yea you are right this is what i do recently

!king
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=kingoftryndamere
!king
why has tfblade played other champs like 20 games?? @foggedftw2
@sweetberrygirl well originally when tf blade made the bet he said trynd only then he didnt take the precautions to keep from getting target banned and got tired of dodging and then asked for secondary champ in promos then asked for secondary champ all together.
whats the best way to comeback if u hard lose lane? @foggedftw2
@hossxxox i completely agree that this is unfair to fogged if it's about climbing with trynd only
Every matchup that tries to go tank against Tryn is boring imo.
Maybe a feed tryndamere emote? Kinda like this buy for trynd https://i.imgur.com/5vRgdaS.jpg

@iTheLefty you can also disable team and allied chat as well and just rely on pings. It's actually pretty soothing and makes you type less
@hossxxox but to be fair tfblade has a higher winrate in trynd right now with more games played
@cutie_eboy also pretty sure fogged played the game for too long that i think he can be decent in other picks

@foggedftw2 do you think putting some points in w vs fast champs is good ?
sorry, haven't been keeping up. Why is tf blade allowed to play other champs?
@foggedftw2 but if he conceeded and it was a 1v1, isn't it over?

of course they do
Do you think if you fought moe 1v1 do you think you would win
!challenge @arab11 tfblade came to fogged and said he cant pick trynd, so tfblade gave up his chance at the prize.

@cngx and Fogged gained visiblity from this anyway so he's not loosing anything by continuing this downgraded challenge

eh fogged still wins out on the challenge either way he wins he gets 2500 he losses he gets akk this free exosure

when do u take conqueror?

how is the conquerors damage better than the huge amount of atack speed u get from lethal tempo???
@foggedftw2 ok thanks bro gl in life
@Shrekenberg What the hell is frankerfaces? :D
ok boomer
1st seems questionalbe since it doesnt provide cdr or other utility
@trihard_from_oceania You need raw AD for armor pen to be effective, it's why AD's take lord doms after 3 items, and why most assassins that need pen go LDR 3rd item.

why no ignte? show runes? what clear path? why jungle over top? why not adc ? what supprot is best in funnel? why conquerero over guardian? does tryndamere scale with health? why no taco for breakfast? why is boxerpete better than you? why no gunblade? why Janna top? Why you no spin in E? Why ER? Why 1 point in R? Why no max W first? Why no update spreadsheet after 1 day of s10?
this song is so good
makes sense I appreciate it good sir. Yeah it looks like your selection is varied, it just seems when I tune it in it seems you have tiamat a lot, just coincidence/chance of when I'm watching I suppose.

@foggedftw2 hey dude what is the best strat to go trynda vs rene?
lol tfblade changed the challenge and backed out because he was losing. #norespectfortfblade
I thought he already lost because he kept playing JAX in non promo games.... ?
@Potatoes_Fries Well, 79-80% winrate, so statwise, they are both really good...

why does tf blade get to play other champs?
just 18 LP LUL
trynd = constantly hitting things
!challenge
If Fogged ends the Month with higher LP, then TFBlade will gift him 500 subs. If TFBlade (who is allowed to play off champs if Trynd is banned) wins then Fogged won't owe him anything. The Trynd only challenge has been rescheduled to May in EUW

do you feel like the odds are against you with tf playing more games and more champs? @foggedftw2
Fogged too big now to thank people for their subs?
this is all triumph and conq
WHY DOES HIS ULT HAVE A 40 SECOND COOLDOWN
Even when you miss Q its like 12

@tgo3333 bro fogged and his chat are the chillest out of any league community. its about improving from where you're at not what people think about how you play anyway. a year from now you'll look back when you're gold and you wont even care regardless anyway :)

@IndomitableDarius not sure how to describe. There's less of a burning feeling because there's no sugar in it
if i play my ass off and get better and get to masters/up, is it even worth the long queue times lol?

@IndomitableDarius they have less of a vitamin taste

Normally fizzy drinks without sugar tend to have some additive that makes you wonder whether sugar is better

alternative sweeteners are of course less harmful than sugar, but still it just tastes too sweet for me in compare to redbull/tiger
@Eddiiee Monster ultra uses erithrytol which doesn't impact your sugar levels and is fine, it isn't aspartame
the ones monster uses are the safest alternative to sugar
might have to try it at work tomorrow then Kreygasm

How can you help people not instantly forfeit lane or jungle? :) Straight up hate confrontation lmao..
@EmmyLeeC That's true. Btw, since i know you and fogged do intermittent fasting, do you guys have the stance that sugar free energy drinks break a fast? I know some people don't but I have the stance that the ones I like do

@foggedftw2 it’s human nature to blame your team unfortunately rather than actually accepting you’re just bad
its like they refuse to win and try everything to lose
@TPangforLife yes we don't drink anything other than water tea or black coffee on a fast
and if you are a support?
dont play support KEKW
Dont play supporting tanks then KEKW
just to be clear, if you win you get the subs but if you lose you dont have to pay anything?

Energy drinks do nothing for me these days I’ve abused caffeine too much LUL
so essentially just put the team on teh back and head to the endzone
hello fogged i wanna ask u about ur age just curious u looks old and good player in the same time
I had someone tell me today that support couldn't carry and that was why they were hardstuck
When are we going to get some of that (Me wizard me trynd me spin me win)???
I´ve never seen fogged lose lane btw

@Eddiiee caffeine can have health benefits in small amounts regardless of delivery system. the health benefits from green tea/ brewed coffee are the antioxidants on top of the caffeine but people overhype the "superfood" benefits to antioxidants lol. green tea def one of the best things you can drink tho

@Parkiet for other dragons: fire removes some bushes and wall, ocean increases bush sizes and spawns honeyfruits in the jungles, wind gives a wind field in the jungle which increases ms when running through, which influence happens then changes all dragons to that type that spawn after until the bar on top of the scoreboard is full and one team gets the "dragonsoul" which is different depending on which dragon influence it is after the soul is gotten elder spawns

Tiamat gives Trynd a stronger early game powerspike, typically better than Zeal rush
Tiamat is a good item for short trades + waveclear early in the game. The !mirardt build skips tiamat to prioritze all ins with lethal tempo

If Fogged ends the Month with higher LP, then TFBlade will gift him 500 subs. If TFBlade (who is allowed to play off champs if Trynd is banned) wins then Fogged won't owe him anything. The Trynd only challenge has been rescheduled to May in EUW

what you can play else than trynda ?
you're actually ok with him playing other champs? what's the point, he's going to get trynd banned more and more as he goes up, and play other champs more and more
Spin spin spln
ty ty
the deal was altered pray he doesn't alter it anymore.
i dont get it, if he wins you owe him nothing, but if you win he gives you 2500$ is it because he is allowed off champs ?
clip trynda vs garen?
He plays more games and doesn't have to dodge. That doesn't seem fair considering the money on the line

@Swayy i think thats the reason
did you main a champ before trynd??
q time locked on 420 foggedWurf
@foggedftw2 trundle top viable in your opinion?
@davormiho the challenge has changed fogged doesn't have to pay tfb if he wins
@foggedftw2 do u dogde when gettin autofilled support?
Until he whines and demands the rules changed again
you should probably mention that unlike him you wont loose money if you loose the challenge

@destryir You play a champ that can remove him from lane by spam poking without using too much resource, e.g. akali/trynd/lucian etc

not like trynd/kled level but pretty good
Other keystones may also be easier for lower skilled people to play, so it's easier to recommend them.

you need to think when playing conq with some champions
i fought a singed last week who did the sirhcez build and it was so hard to deal with after he got gunblade
if conqueror is getting a hotfix, is it even worth trying out this current conqueror? lmao
Trick is just a clown. I don’t get why he waist time playing with that guy. Silly to me.

@Junicavi Fogged allowed him to pick other champs in diamond+ promos if he got snipe-banned. Then Blade started picking other champs even outside of promos and making no effort to not have Trynd banned.

@foggedftw2 no no mordes build man
@Adoinc im guessing youre delusional EU player but that dorans build is from KR
is the bet over cause tf used other champs
Is trynda JGL can make you climb ?
im one game away from retiring from league lol
tf used other champs but fogged allowed it
why he is playing on this account ?
it goes til the end of the year
hmmm
@fivefingerdeathspin So tf lose the challenge already?
Low key trynd without bloodline feels soo bad
d1 NA morde 1 tricks taught me wrong then
vs fiora ignite or ghost ?
doesnt he take your stats after he kills you?
@imaugment naw he allowed it because he was being stream sniped and banned
so who is winning the bet haven't been on for awhile
so NA is wrong for building it but also wrong for not building it @Adoinc typical EU player

grasp is better then conq but only slightly and only during lane, conq scales way better and gives access to both triumph and nimbus cloak instead of just one

and whomever asked the pros of a call center job the negatives are you don't move so if you don't workout on your own you gain a lot of weight, it can be stressful, some of them you deal with the general public, they are often open 24/7, can have air quality issues

If Fogged ends the Month with higher LP, then TFBlade will gift him 500 subs. If TFBlade (who is allowed to play off champs if Trynd is banned) wins then Fogged won't owe him anything. The Trynd only challenge has been rescheduled to May in EUW

Like if you’re red team, and you engage blue down towards his tribush and the creeps end up following you, it can be a struggle to get around them all because they stacked around there. Sometimes it paths you into turret range

I'm pretty sure he got eldered there
no it was your animation of elder drake @foggedftw2
you actually got eldered thats insane
You died to Kaisa's last passive it
Idk what happened there
!challenge
no she just auto attack to death like hash said op damage from kaisa
no the elder animation was going off, but you died to kai'sa's passive, you can clearly see her proc it @foggedftw2
he didnt get eldered
wait why is the challenge rescheduled/
oh i see you were gona elder her and it got canceled fogged
Lux ?
GG EZ
no , u elder her but u died before is cast so ...
you can see the elder line on his hp bar when he's ressing from guardian angel
https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyUnusualRadicchioSuperVinlin @foggedftw2
GG elder buff op
then why would the dragon pop up? he didnt have her close enough to die from elder
!why
why no ignte? show runes? what clear path? why jungle over top? why not adc ? what supprot is best in funnel? why conquerero over guardian? does tryndamere scale with health? why no taco for breakfast? why is boxerpete better than you? why no gunblade? why Janna top? Why you no spin in E? Why ER? Why 1 point in R? Why no max W first? Why no update spreadsheet after 1 day of s10?

that was kaisa
it was your animation bruh
GG
lol
https://clips.twitch.tv/SillyCrunchyAlmondBatChest
she wasnt low enough for elder
It was youir own elder popping
yeah, i think the dismounting animation must change your hitbox zero, so it played the elder animation in a weird way, then you died from else
the clip makes literally no sense when u slow it down
You can even see the little Red/white Line from Elder on yourself.
can you give me Xin zhao top runes ???plz
foggedRNG
@masterbrojason no
@masterbrojason xD?
you even have an elder execution line on your hp bar
@arartorias she wasnt low enough to get executed and the dragon still do the animation
why not
Ohh maybe it was your Elder being cast after you were "dead" and GA popped
yes he mains zhin xhao @masterbrojason
it was your elder popping even tho she wasnt low enough. i think its a bug because she went invis. you didnt get damaged by elder
you eldered yourself during GA
just kidding xd
i think you eldered yourself through GA
rewind
try it in practice tool maybe
foggedWizard
@foggedftw2 look at ur hp bar u have the elder execute red line for some reason
Kaksa went invisible

@foggedftw2 try it in practice tool it looks like a GA bug
atleast you got on a clip video or two now
@foggedftw2 you got 1 shot by something that did around 700 dmg at the same time it was devided by 100 AD and 600 AP dmg
you can see elder wings show up
It didn't do the true damage, just the animation appeared
yeah i think fogged is right
wasnt her passive
wasn;t laisa
@diamondteethking tell me how?
!lp
Challenger
same animation as the other day when kai was autoing trynd while ulted and kept procing the animation
did you hit yourself with hydra?
ESPORTS READY
that little was from her dps
kaisa does not have an execute lol
!op.gg
maybe you walked infront of elder ?
i dont think he died to kai'sa, it just looked like it because elder was delayed
The Dragon wings showed up
if it was kaisa you could see the debuff on him tick for the pop
that's a clear bug. bottom right hand corner can report htose.
little bar*

THE SUPER DEV, HASHINSHIIIIIN!
the super top KEKW
@draxonicar yeah I know, but its not an execute like elders or pykes ult
if riot would listen to hashinshin mages would be gutted to death and aatrox would be insanely broken
@foggedftw2 do i report my inters to hashinshin instead of rito supp KEKW
aatrox would be top tier if riot listened to hash
@dezarth kaisa passive dmges u in a burst, he died as elder popped above him, kaisa killed before elder animation finishes
yeah, it was BEFORE the animation
clip ?
maybe elder lieks kaisa?
elder didnt damage you, auto killed. i think elder was just a visual bug

im surprised that hashinshin is one of the few who know who Dunkey is.

elder too slow
idk, kaisa passive does a LOT of damage
@foggedftw2 excuse me what are you talking about, l just joined ur stream.
but the elder bar was on him
@menutroll explain the elder tho
@capslord hash doesn’t want aatrox to be broken. He actually recommends many things that keep aatrox toned down. But right now aatrox is shit nerfed
already watched the clip @Potato_The_Super_Spud @SortaSloth
Check replay and damage?
You can see the dragon wings kill you @foggedftw2
https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyUnusualRadicchioSuperVinlin @Whiteshark1998
@menutroll does it do 600 AP dmg in 1 hit tho?
@SortaSloth pls
someone link clip plz
hasintint pepeLaugh
for some reason both fogged and veigar had the execute bar
@kuroka33 u must be delusional to think few ppl know dunkey
check replay in game?
hey fogged just got back from basketball training how your previous games go?
@SRishi1234 no like download replay

You were way lower than Elder dragon threshhold when the Kaisa got 5 stack passive damage on you. THen you died. Then the Elder animation played

@chrusherofevil CAUSTIC WOUNDS: Kai'Sa's basic attacks, Void Seeker Void Seeker, and nearby allies' Stun icon immobilizing effects mark enemies with Plasma for 4 seconds, stacking up to 4 times. Kai'Sa's attacks or Void Seeker Void Seeker can then rupture enemies with 4 Plasma, consuming them to deal 15% (+ 2.5% per 100 AP) of the target's missing health magic damage, capped at 400 against monsters.

why no ignte? show runes? what clear path? why jungle over top? why not adc ? what supprot is best in funnel? why conquerero over guardian? does tryndamere scale with health? why no taco for breakfast? why is boxerpete better than you? why no gunblade? why Janna top? Why you no spin in E? Why ER? Why 1 point in R? Why no max W first? Why no update spreadsheet after 1 day of s10?

TF Blade played Other Champs because Fogged allowed it after he was getting sniped and target banned. Only allowed for Diamond and Master promos.
TRUE KEKW
I think its reasonable, if he plays his better champs ppl will less likely ban trynd and you could even just subtract non trynd game lp
he is doing it anyway
true true
w.e fair point tho @Snarkster

dude just fucking let him play another champ if trynda gets banned wtf

You are def way better to watch than him anyway. TF is legit just tilting to see play
Dont let him control your bet
Lol the whole point was a trynd chall
!op
TRYND ONLY BET WTF
ye
@Atsomi are you referring to the game right now
dont get pushed
he's playing irelia as this discussion unfolds btw
@foggedftw2 he can do it that way if he pays the bet, this is just weaselling out
Check out my new merch! https://merchlabs.shop/collections/foggedftw2
This challenge sucks ResidentSleeper
Couldn’t you just subtract 15 LP per non trynd win at the end of challenge?
OR HE PAYS UP
How can Play Trynd in high elo then LUL
Maybe if TF took any effort to hide his queue he wouldnt have this problem
hes just playing irelia anyway
IKR
gj
so we win the bet?
Lol you have 1k people watching and he has 8k🤷🏿♀️
........
trueeeeeeee
Less than a week and TF cracks lol
KEKW
But its true, he literally shows when he presses FIND MATCH and when it pops out the match is founded, then if someone dodges he doesnt restart Q and just keeps watching videos. He barelly has any delay
TriHard
streamer drama? LUL gimme gimme
that's good fogged, telling him like it is
Savage fogged.

I blame riot
He shows champ and doesn’t hide client so his fault

Its called a challenge for a reason LUL
Tf blade is always like this. Like when he was in EU promising to gift subs to viewers and didnt a couple of times
call him
its wrong
@freckling mmhm
only ever got ranked 30?...first world problem.
he says he cant reply
he s weak because he s behind
woah
can't tfblade just play on an alt account after the dodges?

lay down the line buddy
true true
@kapatic16 pff only rank 30, what a shitter Kappa
@foggedftw2 he wont reply he aready gave first blood

he just cant win lol
the difference is that TF has like 5x the viewers and gets targeted way more

KEKW KEKW
he could easily hide his client though.. like you don't know fogged is in a game until the game starts..
fogged MALDING KEKW
I mean both of them stream at the same time, they get targeted almost the same
@Zylla_Music again, hide client, wait a bit to queue up, problem solved
You are way out of his league, way out of his league
he needs something to win lol
he is ingame
whats the problem ? he's playing irelia ?
the difference is one of them hides que, put delay, etc. while the other just talks shit whiel showing everything with 0 delayt @Zylla_Music

yo chill fogged
we got sssnake emotes, will we get cheater emotes too? LuL
i mean he is getting perma banned what can he do about that i don't get it
@Zylla_Music that doesnt matter?? ppl in their elo check their streams purposefully its not like they just dont see fogged cause he has less viewers
@Zylla_Music he also showed queue pop multiple times and doesnt take mini breaks between queueing up in a region where even mid diamond is snipable LUL
lol he is in game
if he hid his client he would get trynda more, people do snipe tf a lot more.. its not about him not winning at all
he isnt even reading rn
Imagine take a word from a guy whos weraing a KEKW shirt lol
why are people so childish
@whyismynamenotavailable hes in the right
I mean I think is hard for him cuz he is a lil bit more known in the community but rules are rules man
@Gonthorian Its there a way to see if TF is in promos? Or did he pick irelia because he is tilted
blade is being deuche
tfbSNAKE
you got snaked bruh
what is the bet?
blade is so bm LMAO
@foggedftw2 he want to call after his game to discuss
hes inting to singed
yea word tfblade has more viewers and hes right hes a streamer first he cant be dodging games over and over again
Tf blade: BabyRage Fogged: Poooound
@foggedftw2 couldn’t you subtract 15 LP per non trynd win at the end of challenge?
@MidnightxPMC he gave up and thinks fogged will accept new terms
an irelia
@midnightxpmc he’s tilted.
@MidnightxPMC Not in promos, trynd is just banned every game
Fogged you know ur just gonna get a ''ok'' from tf KEKW
TF needs to just admit he cant hang
looks like this is over boys, pack ur things
he says he wants to discuss his reasoning in discord lol @foggedftw2
@MidnightxPMC he is not in promos
what happened here ?
does he not realize how scummy he is being>
I mean all things considered the biggest fucking point is why would he, TF Blade, be the one to initiate the challenge, then not accept his own fukin rules man..
nice bet
What if you just check the win loss rate with trynda in op gg? and with thtat you choose the winner? that way he can play whatever champs he want @foggedftw2

@foggedftw2 yeah ur legit right my b
Ditch the Challenge
@foggedftw2 you are 100% in the right, he is completely disrepecting the challenge. he isn't doing what he can. why bother challenging you to trynd only if hes going to do this
his own chat is on your side fogged, they all calling him and cheater and btw he is getting destroyed as irelia rn
yep fog right. blade ruined bet
@zundervain yeah idk man it just doesnt make any sense at this point hahahaha so weak

WAH waaah look him cry
true @foggedftw2
hes losing as irelia anyway PepeLaugh
What is this tts KEKW
@Zylla_Music ????????????????????
It happens everytime, I watch him enough to see that happen multiple times
Hi @foggedftw2 someone has to give you 2500 dollars <3
fogged is OTP trynda ALL YEAR and can play all day rarely dodging. this is just snaking
His chat is eating him alive LUL
wasnt HE the one who initiated this challenge @foggedftw2
@zundervain TFBlade is saying because people dislike him and know about him more that he gets target banned more often.
@foggedftw2 just check the winrate % of trynd and total wins of trynd. that way he can play every champ but only trynd counts to the bet
@foggedftw2 hes on a losing streak too so hes tilted
yeah why wasnt the bet about WR% @foggedftw2
Tf has a bigger champion pool

@foggedftw2 have you watched TFblade before? what made you think he would honor his words bro

one game of irelia wont change anything in the bet, just MINUS the LP if he wins @foggedftw2
so the problem is that he's not playing trynd ?
@AceRocola can u check whispers please AYAYA
bottom line is a bet is a bet and hes clearly cheating, im a tf blade fan but he needs to pay up
@foggedftw2 add kled as 2nd champ or another champ neither of u play
IRELIA KEKW

He's in the wrong for all those reasons but I do get why he's frustrated at THIS point. Going 2 hours before being able to play is really aggravating. His community is just more toxic and wants to target ban more I guess

that take malp or kled only when try is banned

he actually lost the challenge, how can tf blade be so dumb LUL
What a joke tbh. WHY do ppl still trust tfblade's word.
Guys lets try not to flame TF too much. He still helepd Fogged out a lot and we should thank him for that

imagine if TF Blade was the smaller streamer
why he plays irelia???

not hiding queue and complaining about trynd bans KEKW
sometimes tryn challenge SeemsGood
TFBlade waited 3 hours for one game because he had to keep dodging, lost 2 games and got really tilted

set the challenge in eu next time
TF says if trynd is banned he wont doge, promos or not
@foggedftw2 what if you guys paypalled the enemy x amount of dollars for every queue they don't ban tryndamere? One random member of enemy team gets $5 each queue they let tryndamere through.
@foggedftw2 i think u should take away Tfblades thing for promos

hi
@foggedftw2 tell TF to put some RESPEK on your name...

he is losing so technically it is ok KEKW
@MidnightxPMC no fuck blade, he helped nothing

why he plays IRELIA????

@foggedftw2 TF Blade made this bet.. don't let him change the rules drastically.. this is for actually cash now. Sort of ridiculous the handicaps he wants for himself when the guidelines were set by him. He wanted a Tryndamere challenge so that's what he gets..
there are actually too many children in the chat, if you dont know the facts just dont type rubbish

@foggedftw2 if you both hide client in queue then people banning trynd wont be able to tell who is who in lobby. you both face the same queuing challenges, this is a part of the bet. he should have known this would eventually happy

maybe you can go for some deal with % benefit that you can get 10% less elo
true. a bet is a bet

can't snipe if you have client hidden
Step 1: Challenge trynda OTP for challenger race. Step2: dont hide client nor wait to reque. Step 3: lose trynda games. Step 4: Change rules ratirlBusiness
@foggedftw2 if trynd gets banned and he wins, couldn’t you subtract 15 LP from his end result per non trynd win?

Foggedftw2 will be competing against TF Blade for playing Tryndamere only to the highest LP they can get by the end of the year. Loser gifts the winner's chat 500 subs. We will dodge if Tryndamere is banned or picked from us. !opggs for accounts comparison
A bet is a bet I don't know whats so hard to understand
@GodfatherDuelLinks that's the kind of cringe shit that isn't needed in these types of bets. don't make it dramatic
@foggedftw2 And this is why win rate after 100 rounds with Trynd would be a better challenge instead of highest LP.
he owes you 500 subs
Cut the western shit : TF Blade @IWillDominate
@IWillDominate here for the drama
@nachoket I mean let's be honest he took the bet for maximum clout not for the actual bet
@Zomg_aFirefighter anytime you say "republicans", "democrats", "liberals", "conservatives", you are attacking people for them believing something different than you. That's like saying "Jews X". literal racism
@Gonthorian I think you'd be mad on either side of this. At the end of the day they're streamers though, and if they can't play the game... then what's the point?
i would say you already won the 500 subs, cuz he didnt stick to the rules !
changing a bet when your losing is so bad
no matter what he says, the terms were made at the start and can't be changed
idk what it is about TFBlade that bothers me
sniped when dont use delay is not sniped thats just dumb
Check out my new merch! https://merchlabs.shop/collections/foggedftw2
@foggedftw2 I'd personnally enjoy if you played other champs. It's your call
its a fucking bet
it's a challenge!! it shouldn't be easy. gotta do what you gotta do
he has more games than you KEKW
@foggedftw2 tell him to have a bit delay and hide the client, that should be okay!
@zylla_music wut
abso-fucking-lutely @Gonthorian
@Mirardt hi I agree with you bro
He changed the bet without discussing
@nevercoppednodrop the one with most total wins is the winner, and the % wr is the tiebreaker
Both of you on at the same time in high diamond doing trynd. I would perma ban that shit if I was in that elo
KEKW
he has more games than you and plays other champs KEKW
like when chase and scrub done the challenge with their champs only, they could keep up in challenger and chose second champs to play with

he is behind cuz he suckks at trynd

Fogged only took the trynd only bet because he is a trynd one trick (for the most part). obviously blade has a better champion pool to climb with. this is why it was trynd ONLY

TF is Malding
You can do this with math, let him play another champ after X amounts of dodges that would break even
@Blaylock no delay, no breaks between queues. bad at hiding client, perma flaming and blaming, using bad logics while other CAN climb with trynd only in that elo LUL no ive seen enough. just manchild behaviour.

@foggedftw2 Why doesn't he hide his client the whole time?

@MidnightxPMC please do
TF BLADE made the bet himself, he can't just ignore the rules that he established
HEY TFBLADE CUCKS..DONATE TO DANNY TO TELL HIM HOW BAD HE IS KEKW
Gimme da sauce
just have him come in and pay up, TF has lost challenge
@foggedftw2 he already has 7 more games and has played 6 games that aren’t Tryndamere. Not only that, definitely seems like he’s going to lose even when not playing the main champ.
at this point u basically won the bet
doesnt matter if fogged had 10 viewers, i would still watch him over blade. stop makign this into a personal competition
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍TF SNAKE
@foggedftw2 at least u can set a specific champ pool so hee cant spawn champs that he known really well then
He should forfiet to be honest, pay you and end of challenge if hes going to try bend the rules to suit him
Blade cheated, hes playing irelia LUL
I think the issue is it gives way to much power to the trolls if ban = dodge. If he isn't forced to dodge they are not as likely to ban Trynd.
it's a forfeit on his part
@foggedftw2 maybe he cuts the lp he gained from playing other champs when the challenge ends
TF cheating and still losing KEKW

@foggedftw2 Do the challenge with Rangerzx ! foggedFOGGERS rngrPog
he's getting shit on as irelia KEKW
make him pay a penalty when he plays a diff champ. buys you 20 subs for every game not with trynd
Hes making the point that his higher view base is what YOU should make room for. You SHOULDN'T and dont...

blade focuses too much on his stream, he wont put delay on
how come hes playing other champs then tryn (tfblade)
@blaylock well I guess it’s whoever’s higher LP then if they can’t play then stop
u exposed the time
true
KEKW
I dont see why everyones being so anal about the fact that now that theyre in an elo where its 100 times easier to get banned out it gives people too much power
tf is just crying and trying to blame everyone but himself. he acts like tryn is an easy champ but cant grt out of diamond

How about you both play a set amount of games in a certain elo and go for the most wins ?
cheating and still losing KEKW
@freelancer_g ciao mbare
@foggedftw2 restrict his top 3 comfortable champs. cant pick those as secondary.
@Gonthorian I agree, the challenge was an absolute shit show from the start... being big streamers and putting money on playing literally 1 champ for a month is going to invite a lot of people to try to impact these games
What would you play if trynda is banned in a promo game?
Sad to say. even in the days of leveling the accts to 30, i was expecting TF to try to change rules/work himself out of the bet. Honestly don't expect anything to come of this bet. But at least fogged gets some extra views
seems he's not the guy to do challenge with, end of story

we all know fogged is the better tryndamere. imo TFblade should be doing everything in his power to play tryndamere.

Yooo
true
@Blaylock yeah I agree it has been weird cause: trynd 20% banrate masters+ even before the challenge
He could just add 5 min stream delay....
sometimes tryn challenge
What does the word "Only" mean? Its seems that I am not understanding @foggedftw2
Ok ok ok lets say Soraka is fine too if Trynd is banned
without account remake, this challenge is void, TF has lost
how come u dont have to wait such q times and u dont get banned, same shit for TF
He broke the contract man
@defaultname85 and want to add new champ to the list if dodged or banned
It's the only thing that makes sense.
if he wants to play other champs why cant he just log onto a different account to play them
HAHAHA
@foggedftw2 you're 100% right hes just being a bitch because hes losing
Fogged danP
TFblade was saying on his stream the other day that he could use another champ for the challenge if tryn was banned
his mentality is that if he plays a majority with trynd it still counts. set him striaght
@foggedftw2 are you foggedftw4?
just add 5min delay @foggedftw2
they say its a new trynn skin :D
I was away for sometime, is there already an agreement?
ONLY TRYNDAMERE, ADD A DELAY STOP SHOWING CLIENT NEARLY 24/7
drama FeelsGoodMan
TFBlade is a Snake 🐍
I understand his frustration completely (2 hours for one game was ridiculous) BUT the fact that he's not hiding client properly and waiting to queue, adding short delay etc. is what makes him in the wrong. I'd tell him that @foggedftw2

@Gonthorian That ban rate is going to be much higher if they continue this to higher elos... just saying

tell him pay u 2500 now and double the bet in a different region that dont stream snipe u guys

Froggedftw2 do a deal with him everytime but only if tryndamere is banned in master+ it cost him 20-50 $ each time he pick an other champ or mayby musst gift subs to the other
@defectivesupport he had a 30mins timer for dodging. The next time he dodge he will be 1hr. That’s a waste of time. Tf is a bigger streamer so he gets targeted way more than fogged

HAH! Imagine Trick2g as Mediator.
good idea @foggedftw2 get a judge
you suffer just as much as he does when trynd is banned, so why is he complaining this much?
DOM
you made a deal... he broke it... nothing more to talk about. he lost
@rjp24 idk about that. as an adult you gotta learn to let shit go. this has been good for both streams already, don't let his faults ruin a good thing
Yeah have @EmmyLeeC mediate
tryndamere is not balanced 72
tf taking advantage of you. Trade off of more viewers for you vs getting hosed on the rules .
@foggedftw2 if you are confident, make him pay 5k if he is allowed to play other champs
lmao just put your foot down and get your 500 subs, cheating ass blade, he still a kid lol
get rangerz to mediate Pog
get qtpWHAT as the third party
can u show us the parrot?
He knows he has no chance, that's why he's doing this childish moves
I am confused with what's so difficult to understand here for him.. my man fukin said TRYNDAMERE ONLY. LUL
@EmmyLeeC you will be biased towards fogge.d. they need a neutral 3rd party
dom would be good
@demacianvalor Idk how often fogged gets trynd picked/banned from him, but I do know that any time TF gets anywhere near challenger, any champ he plays gets banned out... it's just a shit show of a challenge limiting this to one champ. that's on both of them

@foggedftw2 or else, you could accept his proposals, but then make him be accountable for the LP gained while using other champs, and subtract that LP at the end. so if he gets 240 lp master, and 125lp of those were gained using other champs, they would be deducted

Blade suggested a tryndamere 1v1, dodge if no trynd. Then fogged let blade play other champs if he was in promos so its not an instaloss. Blade then starts losing the bet and complains about how tryndamere is being banned. Keep in note fogged doesnt have problems with this because he FULLY hides client and plays with 15 second delay, unlike Blade. Blade then locks in a new champion before asking fogged and calls him the cheater.

@GreenV1rus thats a +1 from me
he's already lost the challenge
fuck that guy]
when trynd is banned just both play aatrox, afk push all laning phase and, this is very importnat, if you die to a gank make sure you immediately tp on your minions
trynd only or no challenge
I think the best solution is you both go in to your promo games with a duo so you dont have to dodge and lose your promo games @foggedftw2.
@foggedftw2 you're expereicned with almost all champions in game, is there any reason you decided to become trynd OTP?
forfeit by losing as non-trynd out of promos
that's it
he loses if he doesnt stay with in the rules, where u dodge if u cant trynd, and u play when u trynd! clear as day bud
@foggedftw2 maybe just play on another account adter dodging like u said earlier
@teacrisis He lost the day he agreed to it LUL
In my eyes he conceded by knowingly breaking the rules

Can you explain some of the items while your not in que?
Clip it or it didn’t happen
Dude, just base the challenge on total wins, instead of LP. so whoever plays more trynd games wins and that makes him dont play other champs @foggedftw2

@campleb2 his frustration is from the length of how long he's going without dodges, that's it more than the "trynd is getting banned" thing.

Dude, just base the challenge on total wins, instead of LP. so whoever plays more trynd games wins and that makes him dont play other champs @foggedftw2
What did I miss? Did TFBlade bail out?
at this point just take the money out of the bet otherwise it's just gonna get too ugly

why doesn't blade just hide client
"Punishment by flame" is a law of the internet LULW
they timed me out for posting it pepeLaugh
I got timed out from his chat for the copy-pasta :(
maybe his team will just start inting him if he doesnt play trynd
@HeMayn He might as well at this point
someone in his chat said "fogged doesnt get inted everygame" l o l
timed out for 2 minutes for posting the copy LULW
@dingasboy_ he does but not properly. when Q pops it shows up.
@foggedftw2 or else, if you ignore my previous suggestion. you could accept his proposal, but whenever he plays another champion, he gives up 50 gifted subs from the final tally if he loses, and they go to yours. so if he uses 3 champs, his award will be 350 subs, but yours would be 650 subs
He perma bans people who “criticize” him , that’s how he focus LUL

hey fogged i saw a lot of streamers tilting on diamond, i think u guys need 3 days of resting. is godd for you and for the challeng
@MidnightxPMC true but its not as bad as straight up accepting
@foggedftw2 say you can both only teemo if trynd is banned and if not must dodge?
Was joke obviously
Check out my new merch! https://merchlabs.shop/collections/foggedftw2
What do i need to do to be as good as you
if they get ocean soul on singed, there is no way tfblad can win
i am sad bet is kinda ruined
think ive lost respecr for TF
can you show us his stream? so we can see with you
yes
@foggedftw2 Discord
Fog Can coach any champ any role
both blotChamp
HOLY SHIT THE PASTAS IN HIS CHAT HAHAHAHA
both teemo
Taimo is Trynd band
@midnightxpmc wrong respect is earned it isn’t a right just because he’s a streamer
Blade started to ban people who calls him as a cheater :D LOOOOOOL
can u play like fa
ipavO both Teemo blotChamp
KEKW @GreenV1rus
fogged jsut call him now. hes dead for the 16th time in 23 minutes
@GreenV1rus KEKW
hes not busy
rap songs?
Why doesnt he just delay like 40 secs.
when trynd is banned just both play aatrox, afk push all laning phase and, this is very importnat, if you die to a gank make sure you immediately tp on your minions

@seismicshard he coaches any champs
thts cracy what an anial he is
That chat is a shit show, I'ma stay in here KEKW
Teemo is the least picked danP
then whoever plays more just wins lol
that would just be who can play more if you did it that way
total wins instead of LP just benefits the person who plays more games

@foggedftw2 he means total wins on tryndamere.
tf is only like 19 right? it would make is actions make more sense tbh
@dessmond107 that reminds me of someone 🤔
Shoutout to you Fogged - you are handling the drama like a champ - always with a cool head - this is why i only watch you
Teemo if Trynd banned danH
@littlegeorgecostanza I support this
More class here then going down to a cheaters level
andddd he dies again in the 1v3 XD
I NEED YOUR HELP! We need to do challenges ASAP for my quarterback club so we can get our free skins! If you arent in the club already you can join here http://bit.ly/foggedqb
@dessmond107 sounds familiar KEKW
are we in queue?
!song
every time i check on TF hes playing anyhting other than trynd
the fairest challenge would be based on win % with a minimum amount of games required. for example you both must play 150 games and higher win% wins
Ehh I was sub 2450
Maybe just win % out of 100 games played. Higher win % wins the bet? @foggedftw2
All of these 12 year olds super butt hurt lol

@foggedftw2 how about win percentage with trynd only as the winner of the bet then he is just wasting time playing other champs
at this point, Blade just hsa to concede. Any rule change sounds like a terrible idea

I think the bet is fine as is, he just knowingly cheated lol
rooPog
Everytime I switch to his stream he's dead
this whole situation is just gonna get fogged harassed by tfblade fans its a lose lose situation
Dodged again danH
foggedftw2 has the high ground. no need to change the rules of battle
where are getting these lofi from.
I really hope TF loses
hes gonna lose the game on his main anyways lmaoooo

@foggedftw2 I can understand him getting sick of playing trynd only, but he could've gone and played on a different account to wind down
tf lost 3 or so already today lol
9 months danP
is followercount public?
Yeah I only learned of this stream due to the challenge. It is now my fav LoL stream
You should give blade anything on this, He cheated without even asking and getting approved first.
Thanks FOG first sub I ever made
true u have so many new subs
@foggedftw2 just compare trynda w/r after you both reach a defined LP in challenger (like 900 LP challenger)
@Isentropicmike I think any reasonable person is
@Arbucks thanks
jax only challenge incoming!
yeah your viewers count is the highest you got in your career, the challenge was BIG win for you

Froggedftw2 do a deal with him everytime but only if tryndamere is banned in master+ maybe you only can play garen.
How about he keeps count of all NON-Trynd games, and the LP he gained from them, and subtracts the LP amount at the end of the challenge?
LISTEN BUDDY
FOGGED IS BETTER, CHANGE MY MMIND
take this to LAN. No one there gives a shit about you gringos.
what tf doing is just unfair
honestly hes just losing face. he challenged, he lenient rules for himself and still backs of LUL

BUY DOOD
He didn't care about you when he picked other champs he even took the piss outa you sayin he has more/better champs

EU POGGERS
\me Ranger already said he won't compete. it's too much stress for him
@neonskylights because Fogged has literally played nothing but Trynd with no issues and is higher LP but TF Blade refuses to delay and hide client so ofc he gets sniped
tf lost 2k wievers in 30 mintues, rip the hype
@Muggenz he is a tryn one trick.. TF has the advantage if they go to other champs which makes the challenge worthless
@KyleXreX depends if they like you or not
@foggedftw2 how is rageblade on trynd these days ????
Kinda lame for now
dude four way comp
hows the TryndamereSometimesChallenge going?
@NeuralProdigy lmao
do the challenge with rangerz
literally teh fix is to hide your client and don't let people see the name of your smurf
but if euw has more trynd mains wont it be harder to get trynd for u two
every one ponies up 500 subs
now he doesnt hide queue anymore
host him after
hes legit showing client again...

@mirroh3 ty :)
twitch chat care more then Fogg
@dayofmajesty495 if tfblade wins, he wont get 500 subs but if fogged wins he get 500 subs
fogg only got a better deal from tfs complaining
@Deals987 Ikr lmfao
blade such a slimey bitch LULW
fogg has such a good deal doing this challenge any way you look at it because of the exposure he gets
@mirroh3 are you joking LULW
we all thought moe was the snake
!King
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=kingoftryndamere
@thedivagent dude then he wouldnt have anything else to do for the rest preseason
Props to blade for stepping up and holding true to the sub part of the deal. pretty honorable to present that deal.
he has a shot at 500 more subs and longer exposure time
so its Fogged against Cheater now
If you are not diamond elo don’t talk. You@don’t know how people in higher elo target ban. The challenge was flawed from the beginning
Typical eu trash Kappa
!opggs
https://na.op.gg/multi/query=spinspinspln%2Ckingoftryndamere
That is probably the best solution. We still get content, Fogged has nothing to lose but exposure and 500 subs to gain, and TF Blade can learn Tryn and maybe even prove he is better Tryn
This is much better for fogged, very smart man. He's risk-free winning 500 subs. He already got exposure this time round. In May he'll get much more. This man should've gotten into big business.
@foggedftw2 you should allow him to play other champs above master, but then deduct the total lp he would have gained playing other champs
@neonskylights wtf are you even talking about? There are obviously less people in high elo. But then that means both he and fogged have the same disadvantage
whats playlist?
too many zoomers who care too much about the challenge KEKW
!opggs
the integrity of the challenge may be ruined by blade but Fogg still gets so so much from this
!opggs
he didn't get a better deal because he already won
@adoinc I know your feeling bro :(
Why you calling Blade a snake when fogged got a free deal when he cant lose money but can win 2,5k
@foggedftw2 whats the point of doing the challenge anymore if its not even trynd only?
also good for tf, he doesnt have to think of another content for the rest preseason which would be really hard cuz there is nothing to do
@KyleXreX it's good content man, that doesn't make you a zoomer lol, they settled in a good way
Check out my new merch! https://merchlabs.shop/collections/foggedftw2
So tfblade snaked out of the challenge so lame
TF worse than Moe?
!king
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=kingoftryndamere
hes better
@foggedftw2 what is the playlist?
@Kveve cuz tf is trying to get out of gifting the subs. basically tf can climb normal
@foggedftw2 Rangerz said so far he isn't that interested, but he also said May is a long ways away so he will see then
It’s never been about the purity of the challenge to tf blade. That’s why it stings.
TF Snake owes you subs

youre too nice
@foggedftw2 had a work call did blade just admit you are a better trynd and he has to change rulez like a spoiled child to try and win @EmmyLeeC
make him pay up
i took a shower what happened
@tfblade Forget about EUW. Just keep going and stop cheating. If you need to dodge, just go play a game on another account while you wait. That way you don't lose content. Or waste stream time? :)
yall savage and not listening. TF JUST MADE IT TO WHERE HE CAN STILL NOT HIDE CLIENT, AND PLAY JAX IRELIA (HIS BETTER CHAMPS). if he gets higher lp now, he doesnt gift
@foggedftw2 Will you be playing other champions then if Trynd get's banned out?
waiting you here on eu west Fogged @foggedftw2

u muted it during the call LUL @foggedftw2
so what are the rules now? i missed the drama
@thedivagent No, but I mean I think they settled it pretty well. If TF Blade just kept choosing other champs without discussing it with Fogged then that would be def shady

@atrance18 i agree on that front but I dont think that its a good settlement for @foggedftw2 . Maybe it is for TF Blade but like I dont know It feels like TF Blade git away with it easy although it looks like fogged isn't as tilted as the rest of the chat like someone else pointed out accurately

TF Blade is still doing the challenge guys, he didn't want to wait because he is trying to learn Tryn anyways, but he just didn't want to wait in queue so he chose a solution that benefits Fogged to make up for him occasionally playing other champs

Fogged means business with his Trynd ratirlBusiness
it's a good deal for fogged, but it just sucks because the challenge has lost all interest... we already know that tf blade can climb higher playing other champs, this was about tryndamere
will you come to Europe next year? @foggedftw2

@foggedftw2 now that the challenge is alternated, would you be trying to practice kled?

I would not have agreed to that, it's basically TF Blade disrespecting the challenge and fogged

@yenoi TF Blade has a pretty big audience and it's really bad content for an entire month to constantly be dodging and waiting in 30 minute queues, so he reached an agreement that benefited both parties
how viable do you think akali will be after the nerfs @foggedftw2
whats the rule with health pots foggedThink
@Blaylock so? rank 1 jax player picks jax and wins 10 extra master games that wouldn't have won with trynda, oh, he got higher LP! what a surprise!
@Blaylock I think fogged meant was he doesn't have to do the gifted subs. Fogged already thanked him multiple times for all of the exposure that he has given him.
@MidnightxPMC shouldn't u also add that the real challlenge will be in may?

@SupremeSovereign dude he doesn't have 100% winrate on jax and 0% on tryn KEKW you can't just calculate it like that
@foggedftw2 it honestly should go back to winrate on trynd, that way you guys can factor out the win rates for secondary champs
@foggedftw2 why do you ban panth over akali still?
its not like fogged idnt have to dodge promo games. and that even with doing way more effort not to get banned

Wait, so TF can play anything if Trynd is banned, but Fogged is sticking with Trynd, and Fogged won't owe TF anything if he loses.... This really doesn't feel like a challenge anymore. Should have stuck to the original rules.
how does a lucian think he not going to get run down by trynd 1v1...

they should rework blitz ult so he can only activate it when he grabs, then he spins the champion around in circle knocking other champs up in the air

He can't win anymore; from now on, he will be playing to not lose the bet only
i see, ty
@miniflid ok ty you
@foxxez_ it depends, at the beginning, the challenge was tryndamere or dodge, then fogged gave a break on bo3/bo5, then if banned... thats just wrong

heyy fogged, are you still using nimbus cloak after the change on it?
@neace why dont u get involved in the challenge
@nevercoppednodrop he says? but TF changes rules as needed.
@gabemonssa Yes
@gabemonssa nimbus still good
guys whats the actual build
@NEACE BIG UP
@King_Prawn <3
anyone wanna play in a while trying to find people to play with
kind of a lame competition now - i wish tf wasn't so egotistical about this, really obnoxious how he starts losing and just changes the rules
@neace make a tankadin only challenge
obviously fogged won't contest because he gets good viewership
but still scummy
@foggedftw2 of wow, almost 2500 subs, last time I saw you fell below then 2k mark, congrats on getting so many back. :)

Blade suggested a tryndamere 1v1, dodge if no trynd. Then fogged let blade play other champs if he was in promos so its not an instaloss.

I mean he already had to cheat to hit d1, he'll change the rules another 100 times lol
Aren't you at a big disadvantage now cause he never has to dodge queue? Now you lose lp and time he doesn't
but even if he beats you it's still not the same
I play IE and Shiv every game on Tryn,
He does have to play trynd if its not banned
@foggedftw2 how did the bet even start?
Is that cause he is getting target banned or what?

I still dont understand why tfblade is allowed to play other champs consistently, without him even being in promos.
Shiphtur watches cooking videos and stuff like that
so what skin did you guys get from twitch prime
How often do you get your hair cut?
What do you think of certain jng champs going top? (stuff like warwick, lee sin, rengar, shaco, etc)

@foggedftw2 honestly at the end of the day people prefer the food they were brought up with so this conversation is pointless since it's not objective.
@foggedftw2 I mean american gastronomy doesn't exist while other countries have famous gastronomies
Donald Trump's Tacos are the best Kappa
I mean not gonna lie, I've wanted to go to some famous place in 'Murica just to try out some food

@theL0rax yes but the benefits are not being seen by the working or middle class - only the rich
you cant get BBQ ribs in Europe.
Can't really compared foods from one portion of the world to another. Take bread for example. In America it contains a ton of sugar compared to here in Europe. Sugar destroys taste buds. :(
As someone from the UK... you can't even go to every city in the UK and find good food...
I think everyone can agree that Asian food is the best.
I go to america every month from mexico and all i can say is that i only like the breakfast from ihop
That is not true, some of the best food in America are hole in the wall restaurants that do not even have a gps location @foggedftw2

why no ignte? show runes? what clear path? why jungle over top? why not adc ? what supprot is best in funnel? why conquerero over guardian? does tryndamere scale with health? why no taco for breakfast? why is boxerpete better than you? why no gunblade? why Janna top? Why you no spin in E? Why ER? Why 1 point in R? Why no max W first? Why no update spreadsheet after 1 day of s10?

I heard in NA only children goes to Mcdonalds, but in my country ppl go there talking business and study like as in a cafe
I have been to Sweden and their Mcdonals is like a steakhouse, it's packed full of good food (and I personally HATE Mcdonalds) but this one was awesome
Playing ranked right now is like playing fkin normal blind games every game at least 1 or 2 pplafk while the other 2 run it down lane hitting no every ff

@emmyleec he thinks 😂
technically he lost lol
TFBlade doesnt have the tenacity to play Trynd like you do
what did you end up working out with TF Blade
why cant he only do tryn tho
@foggedftw2 Cheer500 I've checked on amazon quickly, it's 110 canadian dollar for laptop ram 16gb ddr4 3000mhz. So maybe like 80 something usd for ya

@foggedftw2 8 gb ram is a bit low tho should spec 16 gb or 32 wich i agree is overkill.
I thought the bet was to prove that TF blade was better at tryn lol so he lost basically
@emmyleec is there a way you could add a command explaining why the challenge got changed?
@HeMayn That laptop would be way more than 110 canadian lmao
@panchos8812 im not sure

wow... what did i miss yesterday. I left wed, and you only had 6 losses...
NO BORK USELESS, GETS REDUCED BY ARMOR
sell items go AP TRYND
@Mirardt cause splitting is basically the whole point of the champ lol
cleaver?
bork rage blade
We are offering him options
Nashors Tooth + Wits End + DEATHCAP
bork not that good, black cleaver better vs him,
buy mortal reminder.. not lord dominics
is the challenge with tf blade still going?
Dont suggest him Wits ffs how would that scale off his crits? FailFish
@foggedftw2 Build BORK + Wits End = Maphite dead in 5seconds
but that aside its useless
Lifesteal spirit bisage or bork
rageblade doesn't stack with last whisper guys lol
Sanguine blade
rageblade has no armor pen lol
PowerUpL foggedWizard PowerUpR
BC and sanguine and ie
rageblade
or maybe cleaver with titanics
@foggedftw2 get rid of tiamat so you can get Botrk, BC and IE?
make tf match malph and you syndra @foggedftw2 thats the counter
Botrk without armor pen does absolutely nothing

you need MR lifesteal and pen, and can beat him
they changed it like 2 years ago yeah

KEKW

lmao thinking words = toxic
Yeah he's super toxic. Even though most of the time Scrub is right, he's trying to project his 1,000lp challenger mentality onto players that are masters at best or low challenger. You know? @foggedftw2

Akali is dumb

He can't do anything with all her spells up
@cptFlamer Nope, the actual conditions are the next. If TF Blade wins he gets nothing (he will be playing his champ pool), if fogged wins (playing trynd only) he will get paid the $2,500
when will riot actually nerf akali like for real
@tevoychuparelburroo okay and she has 3 gapclosers and flash to get away when all he has to do is farm to win

you did your best man <3

@SilentJungler77 yeah, he lost the game there in my opinion
i thought you were banning akali?
it wasnt your champ,... the teamfgiht could be won if the varus and tar5ic wasnt so bad
if karthus hit the smite on that elder u guys had a chance i think
Some Games are like this. Thank you, next
@tovskiitov talking shit in pms then blocking weirdChamp

But the dmg will remain the same
smote
8% heal for ranged, instead of 15%
smote it
smote KEKW
smote it KEKW
karthus should have went olaf
riot games : lets make the bruiser keystone op on mages !
thats not a "Miss the smite" he directly didnt use it, the elder was at 600 app when poppy smited lmfao
akali is the shittiest champ i had seen in m life
I want to see clip of yasuo play
laughing at proper grammar KEKW
Just look at varus positioning in that last baron fight...
surprised senna wasn't banned
at drag
Duration will be 8sec > 6sec, healing from 15%> 8%, this nerf will be in next patch I think
Conq for ranged getting nerfed, Akali getting nerfed more, Senna getting hard nerfed... I mean that comp was worse than a tryn ban
ulted by who?
is all stars fun this year?
@Nydous hes not hating on tf blade because of his succes. keep in mind he got banned for other stuff too. hes literally the guy who said all turkish players are dogs. then cried like a lil beech when TR players punished him. and he got himself banned being toxic their.
Karthus is fine, yas just neeed to hit ult on cassio or pyke
why conq range though. it's only mages that abuse it. Conq is not too op twitch or Draven, it just makes them playable
taric was also very USELESS
